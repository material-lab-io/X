    "2/6 Docker containers go through distinct states: Created \u2192 Running \u2192 Paused \u2192 Stopped \u2192 Removed. Each transition is managed by the Docker daemon.",
    "3/6 Here's how it works visually:\n\n\ud83d\udcca [Flowchart Attached Below]",
    "4/6 The `docker run` command does THREE things: 1) Creates container from image 2) Allocates resources 3) Starts the process. Magic! \u2728",
    "5/6 Pro tip: Use `docker ps -a` to see ALL containers (including stopped). Many devs miss this and wonder where their containers went! \ud83d\udd0d",
    "6/6 Understanding lifecycle = better debugging. Next time a container acts weird, check its state first! What's your biggest Docker challenge? \ud83d\udcac"
