  "Here's a thread about Docker caching and how it can make your builds faster",
  "Docker builds can be slow if you don't use caching properly. Every time you change your code, Docker might rebuild everything from scratch",
  "The key is to order your Dockerfile commands from least to most frequently changing. Put system dependencies first, then requirements, then your code",
  "Also use multi-stage builds to keep your final image small. You can have a build stage with all dev dependencies and copy only what you need to the final stage",
  "Docker caching can make your builds much faster. I've seen builds go from 15 minutes to under 3 minutes just by fixing the Dockerfile order",
  "Hope this helps with your Docker builds!"
